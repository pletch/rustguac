# Credential Variables

Credential variables let connections entries reference shared credentials by name instead of storing passwords directly. Users maintain their own credential values in Vault via the **My Credentials** dialog (the **Credentials** link in the top navigation, or the gear menu). When a session launches, rustguac substitutes the variables from the user's saved values.

This gives a similar experience to LDAP credential passthrough in Apache Guacamole — users log in once and sessions just work — without rustguac needing to bind to LDAP. Credentials stay in Vault, never on disk or in the browser.

## How it works

1. **Admin** creates connections entries with variable references like `$corp_username` and `$corp_password` in the credential fields
2. **Users** open **My Credentials** from the gear menu and fill in their values (stored per-user in Vault)
3. **At connect time**, rustguac substitutes the variables. If all are set, the session launches silently. If any are missing, the user is prompted.

## Variable naming

Variables start with `$` and use the pattern `$<domain>_<suffix>`:

| Pattern | Purpose | Input type |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `$<domain>_username` | Username | Text |
| `$<domain>_password` | Password | Password (masked) |
| `$<domain>_domain` | AD/Windows domain | Text |
| `$<domain>_key` | SSH private key | Textarea |

The `<domain>` is a logical name chosen by the admin to group related credentials — for example `corp`, `jumpcloud`, `lab`, or `cloud-prod`. Multiple entries can reference the same domain, so users only configure their credentials once.

**Allowed characters:** lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. For example: `$corp_username`, `$jump-host_password`, `$cloud-prod_key`.

## Example

An admin creates two connections entries:

- **Production SSH** — username: `$corp_username`, password: `$corp_password`
- **Staging SSH** — username: `$corp_username`, password: `$corp_password`

Both reference the same `corp` domain. A user opens **My Credentials**, fills in their `corp` username and password once, and both entries work without further prompting.

An entry can also mix variables with static values. For example, an RDP entry might have a static hostname and port but use `$ad_username`, `$ad_password`, and `$ad_domain` for credentials.

## Importing from Guacamole

When migrating from Apache Guacamole, the `import-guacamole` command can convert Guacamole's `${GUAC_USERNAME}` / `${GUAC_PASSWORD}` passthrough tokens directly into credential variables with its `--map` flag, so imported connections arrive already wired to My Credentials. See [Mapping credential tokens](migration.md#mapping-credential-tokens).

## Where variables can be used

Credential variables are expanded at connect time in the following entry fields:

| Field | Applies to | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| `username` | SSH, RDP, VNC, Web | Authentication username for the target |
| `password` | SSH, RDP, VNC, Web | Authentication password for the target |
| `domain` | RDP | AD/Windows domain |
| `private_key` | SSH | SSH private key contents |
| `container_username` | VDI | Username used to log into the VDI container (only when set on the entry; otherwise auto-derived from the operator identity) |
| `container_password` | VDI | Password used to log into the VDI container (only when set on the entry; otherwise ephemerally generated) |

VDI entries that auto-derive credentials (the default for images that honour `VDI_USERNAME`/`VDI_PASSWORD`) do not need credential variables. They only apply when an admin has set explicit `container_username` / `container_password` overrides for an image with a baked-in account.

## My Credentials dialog

Open it from the **Credentials** link in the top navigation bar, or from the
gear menu. The dialog:

- Shows all credential variables used across entries the user has access to
- Groups variables by domain prefix, with each group collapsible
- Provides a filter box (shown once the list is long) to find a variable by name or domain
- Indicates how many entries use each variable
- Masks password and key fields (saved values are not shown, but a placeholder confirms they exist)
- Scrolls its body while the title and the Save/Close buttons stay pinned, so it stays usable with many variables
- Supports partial saves: fill in what you have now, come back later for the rest

### Finding what needs setting up

The Connections page surfaces missing credentials before a connection fails:

- A **"credentials needed"** pill marks entries that reference a variable you have not set yet.
- A dismissible banner reports how many credentials are still to set up. The dismissal is remembered across refreshes and only reappears if a genuinely new unset credential shows up.

## Graceful degradation

- **All variables set:** the session launches immediately, no prompting.
- **Some missing:** the connect opens My Credentials focused on just the missing variables, and the connection resumes automatically once you save them.
- **None set:** full credential prompt (same as entries without variables).

## Shared and local credentials (multiple Vaults)

When more than one Vault backend is configured (see
[Multiple Vault backends](configuration.md)), each credential can be stored in
the **shared** Vault (propagates to every site) or kept **local** to this
instance. My Credentials shows a **"Shared across sites"** checkbox per
credential; the default for a new credential comes from
`user_credentials_default_scope`. Reads merge both backends (a local value wins
over a shared one of the same name), and toggling a credential moves it between
the two.

With a single Vault there is only one store, so the checkbox is hidden and every
credential is simply stored there.

Trade-off to be aware of: a credential kept in the shared Vault will not resolve
while that Vault is unreachable, so a connection that references it fails even if
the target and the local Vault are up. Keep credentials a site must never lose
(for example break-glass logins) **local**.

## Vault storage

User credentials are stored in Vault KV v2 at:

```
<base_path>/users/<sanitized_email>
```

Each user gets a single Vault secret (per backend) containing their credential key-value pairs. Variable names are the keys, plaintext values are the values. The Vault policy must allow read/write to this path for authenticated users.

With multiple Vault backends configured, a user's credentials are split by scope: local credentials live at this path in the local backend, shared credentials at the same path in the shared backend. The `users/*` policy is needed on whichever backends hold credentials.

### Required Vault policy

In addition to the existing connections policy, add:

```hcl
# User credential variables (read/write own credentials)
path "secret/data/rustguac/users/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
path "secret/metadata/rustguac/users/*" {
  capabilities = ["list", "read", "delete"]
}
```

## API endpoints

| Method | Path | Role | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/me/credentials` | operator+ | List own saved variables (passwords masked) |
| `PUT` | `/api/me/credentials` | operator+ | Save/update own variables |
| `GET` | `/api/credential-variables` | operator+ | List all variables used across accessible entries |
